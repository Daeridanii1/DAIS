## DAIS: *Daeridanii's Additional Interesting Ships*

A plugin for the open-source space game [Endless Sky](https://www.github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky), adding a collection of fully-modeled ships, each in the design family of an existing vessel or group of vessels. The goal is for these to slot in seamlessly as part of a sort of "vanilla-plus" experience, adding diversity and interest to shipyards and fleets throughout human space without changing up game balance too drastically.

### Current Additions
* **Light Warships**
    * _Lindwurm_: Fast and fanciful, a smaller sibling of the Lionheart Corvette.
    * _Hydrargyrum_: Resembles the Megaparsec Quicksilver with a heavier armament.
* **Medium Warships**
    * _Erinys_: A medium warship made by Southbound Shipyards for the Free Worlds to fight alongside their larger Dreadnought.
* **Heavy Warships**
    * _Moonbeam_: The Falcon of yesteryear, a fast heavy warship in the style of the CCOR-era ships. _(Plus a Marauder-esque variant!)_

### Other Info
All-content plugin support for testing and cheating is provided through [Omnis](https://www.github.com/DarcyManoel/-Omnis).

DAIS is kept up-to-date with the latest **unstable** release of Endless Sky.
