			`While exploring what passes for an upscale bar at this planet's spaceport, you notice that the other patrons have suddenly quieted down. A tall, older woman walks over to the bar and retrieves a glass of something before approaching you.`

			`	"I am Our Lady of the Serrated Blade. I ran a little piratical outfit out of here back in the day, but these days I'm just a simple businesswoman. It's amazing how effectively you can liberate credits from the weary and well-to-do alike with nothing more than fine imported whiskey and the impression that you're accustomed to violence. And as it so happens, I recognize between us the telltale heralds of a mutually beneficial transaction."`

Stargazer Shipyards Moonbeam, circa 2620, not factory-new of course - what is these days, I swear Tarazed has a whole team of 'scratch engineers' who key the entire damn hull right there in the factory - but still purrs like a kitten and makes shame for those potbellied Republic hulks." She mimes spitting on the ground.`
			`	"I used it for smuggling squirrel-tech in the '80s, but after I got out of starside business, didn't really have much use for it. Could sell it for scrap or to some fat-cat corpo from the Paradise Worlds, but there's nothing that would please me more than to see it in the hands of some young but, shall we say, provably effective troublemaker. You see, I've become sentimental in my old age."`

Forty-eight million, and I'll get one of my friends to do what he can with the shield matrix. Might not be quite as clean as what they do in Tarazed, but I bet he'll squeeze an extra ten percent out of it. Maybe fifteen if he hasn't had too much to drink. What do you say?"`
