	description `Produced in tandem with Lionheart's new Corvette medium warship, the sleek and firey Lindwurm doubles down on the characteristics that made its larger sibling such a success. Though classed as a light warship, the Lindwurm punches well above its size and exhibits unparalleled agility thanks to its lightweight hull; though this does mean that it relies almost entirely on its shields for defense. The premium price tag of these ships puts them squarely out of reach of less successful merchants, but their rapid interception capabilities have made them an effective component of larger freight convoys as well as the internal security services of the Deep.`

	description "Though the Quicksilver's enduring popularity with corporate customers has made it a ubiquitous feature of core space, its spartan design and limited outfitting options have made it a less desirable choice among independent pilots. Megaparsec's new Hydrargyrum light warship is designed along the same lines as the Quicksilver, but can carry up to double its armament, making it among the most powerful warships of its class. Despite this, its interior space remains restrictive, and pilots will have to choose between having effective shield generation and reverse thrust."

	description "The Erinys is a powerful mid-size warship designed by Southbound Shipyards for the Free Worlds, a durable destroyer with oversized engines strong enough to go toe-to-toe with a Republic Navy Frigate and fast enough to harass and waylay a Cruiser. Built of the same high-quality materials as the Dreadnought and equipped with the best the Free Worlds have to offer, a battlegroup of Erinyes is just as fearsome as their mythological epithets would imply."
