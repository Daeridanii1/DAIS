	description "The Erinys is a powerful mid-size warship designed by Southbound Shipyards for the Free Worlds, a durable destroyer with oversized engines strong enough to go toe-to-toe with a Republic Navy Frigate and fast enough to harass and waylay a Cruiser. Built of the same high-quality materials as the Dreadnought and equipped with the best the Free Worlds have to offer, a battlegroup of Erinyes is just as fearsome as their mythological epithets would imply."

	description "Though the Quicksilver's enduring popularity with corporate customers has made it a ubiquitous feature of core space, its spartan design and limited outfitting options have made it a less desirable choice among independent pilots. Megaparsec's new Hydrargyrum light warship is designed along the same lines as the Quicksilver, but can carry up to double its armament, making it among the most powerful warships of its class. Despite this, its interior space remains restrictive, and pilots will have to choose between having effective shield generation and reverse thrust."

	description `Produced in tandem with Lionheart's new Corvette medium warship, the sleek and fiery Lindwurm doubles down on the characteristics that made its larger sibling such a success. Though classed as a light warship, the Lindwurm punches well above its size and exhibits unparalleled agility thanks to its lightweight hull; though this does mean that it relies almost entirely on its shields for defense. The premium price tag of these ships puts them squarely out of reach of less successful merchants, but their rapid interception capabilities have made them an effective component of larger freight convoys as well as the internal security services of the Deep.`
	description `	The shared names of the Lindwurm and a certain Quarg freighter have not escaped notice, especially in the more southerly areas of human space. Though Lionheart corporate dismisses this as a mere cultural coincidence, one of the Lindwurm's lead designers claims - to some ridicule - that the Quarg, in fact, stole the name from her.`

	description `The Hekla is a traditional design from the shipyards of Thule, only a very distant cousin to any other ship in human space. Even though Thule is now well-enough connected to the rest of the galaxy, these still lag a generation or so behind the craft coming out of larger-name shipyards, in exchange for being reliable and exceptionally versatile. Most of the ships are etched by the lead shipwright in charge of manufacturing them, and despite the basic design being ubiquitous on Thule, many operators swear by their preferred builder as giving them an extra edge.`
	description `The Dora version is popular among freelance miners for its pair of drone bays and large cargo hold, though it can also function as a combat carrier if equipped with armed drones.`

While one of these craft won't quite stand up to the likes of a Bastion or Frigate, they continue to be popular among southwestern pirates for their cargo space and hardpoint flexibility.`

	description `The Moonbeam was its generation's equivalent to the Tarazed Falcon, a blazingly quick heavy warship that traded durability for unparalleled speed in its weight class. Back in the day, these vessels made for fearsome convoy escorts, posing a serious threat to pirates unprepared to execute a rapid escape.`
	description	`	The design has long been out of production and the ship's notoriously temperamental power systems have kept it from enjoying the same enduring popularity as designs like the Firebird and Berserker. Nonetheless, the ample engine bays and lightweight hull of the Moonbeam have made it a rare and beloved possession of the few lucky enough to still have one; these old ships are still the fastest heavy warships in the sky.`

	description `First built by industrial manufacturer Janus Systems in the early 2930s, the Reflection class of intra-system tugs was designed to reposition space stations, fielding an astonishingly massive engine block. Though Janus went bankrupt by the 2980s, the occasional well-maintained Reflection still travels the stars, though by now they have mostly landed in the hands of pirates and other unscrupulous figures who have converted them into either rapid freighters or unusual, if effective, medium warships.`
	description `	Large forward-mounted radiators, designed to radiate engine heat at low velocity, give the Reflection excellent thermal performance at the cost of greatly weakening its hull.`
